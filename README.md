Homework for coding bootcamp

Didn't finish. I am having a lot of trouble with moments.js and with the handling of the database. I am not able to update the time differences to the databese. I invested about 15 hours in the homework, focused mainly on the code, and therefore did not do any kind of design at all, I thought the code was more important.... even though I didn't finished.. ugh.
